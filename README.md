## Lucia Gore

I am a diligent and ambitious student at Makers Academy in London, Europes leading fully immersive full-time developer Bootcamp, with the intention of starting a career as a developer. I am looking for a new challenge in which I can implement my creative and analytical skills as well as learn and build confidence in programming and code. 

Prior to Makers, I spent 3 years in Sales and Marketing roles, specifically focussed on Luxury Travel, in which I was fortunate to spend time both in London and Kenya. I decided that I wanted to become a developer because of the unbounded opportunities that it offers. Ideally I would be looking for a role in which I could build upon my passions, namely design, travel and entertainment - improving on the skills I've learnt at Makers Academy - whilst working on a variety of relevant projects. I am thorough and precise with a keen interest in technology, mobile applications, artificial intelligence and user experience. 



My working life has almost entirely been based around client facing roles and the service industry and therefore I have an indepth understanding of the attention to detail and responsibility required. I have forged a love of conservation in particular, given the exposure I've had to products dependent on conservation.

## Interests

I enjoy travel, photography and videography - I find these all go very well together and I try to document my own adventures in the way of scrapbooks, short films and stories.

I am an avid reader, I enjoy the theatre, (drama and musicals) and I also have a huge appreciation for film - both animation and live action. I play the piano and love learning new scores.
