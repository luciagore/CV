## Lucia Gore

I am a diligent and ambitious student at Makers Academy in London, Europes leading fully immersive full-time developer Bootcamp, with the intention of starting a career as a developer. I am looking for a new challenge in which I can implement my creative and analytical skills as well as learn and build confidence in programming and code. 

Prior to Makers, I spent 3 years in Sales and Marketing roles, specifically focussed on Luxury Travel, in which I was fortunate to spend time both in London and Kenya. I decided that I wanted to become a developer because of the unbounded opportunities that it offers. Ideally I would be looking for a role in which I could build upon my passions, namely design, travel and entertainment - improving on the skills I've learnt at Makers Academy - whilst working on a variety of relevant projects. I am thorough and precise with a keen interest in technology, mobile applications, artificial intelligence and user experience.  


## Skills
 
#### Sales

I am results driven and thrive by using my initiative, and working under pressure. I enjoy the sales process and succeed in building and maintaining relationships with suppliers and clients alike. I have excellent written and verbal communication skills and have conducted presentations and webimars, as well as written articles and blogs. I spent over two years working in the Sales team at Original Travel, in which I was recognised as one of the most successful Sales Consultants, arranging private and corporate itineraries for clients around the world. Almost all my previous work has been in client facing roles, and in some cases included bidding for projects against others at the company or in other companies. I have strong negotiating skills and a good attention to detail.

#### Marketing

I have spent time focussed on the marketing techniques for both Original Travel and Nigel Archer Safaris by implementing Social Media channels, targeting and analysing consumer demographics, as well as creating brochures and and online content. I have arranged and attended events in which to promote a product and service (Naibor Safari Camp).

#### Management

I spent several months working full-time at Naibor Safari Camp, assisting the Camp Manager with all aspects of the daily running of camp, including staff management. This would ensure the best possible experience for both staff and guests and the safety of all those involved.

Competant in French and Spanish

## Interests

I enjoy travel, photography and videography - I find these all go very well together and I try to document my own adventures in the way of scrapbooks, short films and stories.

I am an avid reader, I enjoy the theatre, (drama and musicals) and I also have a huge appreciation for film - both animation and live action. I play the piano and love learning new scores.
