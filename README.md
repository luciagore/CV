## Lucia Gore

I am a diligent and ambitious problem solver, currently studying at Makers Academy in London, with the intention of starting a new career as a developer. After 3 years in Sales and Marketing, specifically focussed on Luxury Travel (both in Kenya and the UK), I am looking to further improve my creative and analytical skills working on a variety of relevant projects. I am thorough and precise with a keen interest in technology, mobile applications and user experience.
