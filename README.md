I am a diligent and ambitious student at [Makers](https://makers.tech/) in London, Europe's leading fully immersive full-time developer Bootcamp, with the intention of starting a career as a developer. I am looking for a new challenge in which I can implement my creative and analytical skills as well as learn and build confidence in programming and code. 

# Background
Prior to Makers, I spent 3 years in Sales and Marketing roles, specifically focussed on Luxury Travel, in which I was fortunate to spend time both in London and Kenya. I craved a more flexible lifestyle, and one in which I could do more to help others and make a positive contribution to the world. For the last year, I have really pursued a growing interest in technology, and the opportunities that it offers. I believe that it provides the tools to do social good, protect the environment in which we live and enhance the lives of individuals. I have a wide range of skills and interests that not only inform my open-minded attitude, but make me uniquely capable of producing great results in the tech space because I can conceptualise the journey from raw code to final user, and the implications of the technical and design choices along the way.

Ideally I would be looking for a role in which I could build upon my passions, namely design, travel and entertainment - improving on the skills I've learnt at Makers - whilst working on a variety of relevant projects.

# Skills

### Writing Test-Driven, Clean Code

Makers has taught me to appreciate and strive for the best quality, test driven, clean code. I have taken on board, and implemented the programming principles such as SOLID and DRY, as well as practicing usage of XP Values to make sure that every code base I work on, is easily understood by myself, other members of the group, as well as anyone else that might be interested! TDD has helped me enormously not just to prevent brittle code, but also to better understand what I am trying to achieve.

### Adaptability

I consider myself a highly adaptive individual able to adjust based on the situation.

Once I arrived to start my placement year in China with Goldwind, I found out during my onboarding process that I wasn't suited for the role they needed. I asked my superior if there was a purpose I _could_ fill in the department. Noticing a communication issue with a different member of staff and an international intern, I inquired if it would be appropriate for me to take care of the English speaking staff and escalate if necessary. It turned out to be a fruitful endeavour, creating a role for myself where I could use the skills I had and providing relief for an understaffed IT team.

### Teamwork / Mediation / Collaboration

Having spent most of my working life before Makers in a team environment, I know and have experienced that all teams have highs and lows. I feel it is paramount to learn as a team and create an inclusive and enthusiastic environment, to achieve the best possible results.

I learnt this in particular in my first group project (recreating our rendition of AirBnb), where there were various clashes, and we realised early on that the most imporant thing to do would be to align our individual goals in order to better work together as a team. Running daily standups and retros, I ensured that our group kept our eyes on the objectives of the day which played a major part in our eventual good group cohesion.

### Attention to detail

This was crucial at my role in Sales, and I have since honed in on this skill to try to achieve high quality and error free code wherever possible.

# Interests

* I enjoy travel, photography and videography - I find these all go very well together and I try to document my own adventures in the way of scrapbooks, short films and stories.
* I am an avid reader, I enjoy the theatre, (drama and musicals) and I also have a huge appreciation for film. I play the piano and love learning new scores. 
* Learning languages - I have found I enjoy the process of learning new languages - besides those I learnt at school - and strive to continue doing so when time allows with a focus on Italian in my spare time.
* Yoga - This year I have dedicated time to yoga and have found that it has really improved both my physical and mental wellbeing
